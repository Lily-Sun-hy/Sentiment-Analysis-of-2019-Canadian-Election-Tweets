# Sentiment-Analysis-of-2019-Canadian-Election-Tweets

In this project, sentiment analysis is performed to analyze the public's opinions on political parties in 2019 Canadian election using relevant tweets.

Data cleaning and parsing is performed using Python's common natural language processing libraries. Then data exploratory analysis is conducted where different political parties mentioned in the tweets as well as common words related to negative and positive sentiments are identified and visualized.

For model preparation, features are prepared using different vectorizing techninques. Then, 7 different classification models are built and implemented on the training dataset. Then, the optimal model and set of parameters are chosen to be implemented on the testing set. In order to take a closer look at the negative sentiments, further data extraction and cleaning, classification as well as hyperparameter tuning are performed using the optimal model and negative tweets training data. Finally, the optimal model is chosen to predict the reason for negative sentiment.

In the end, all analyses are summarized, visualized and presented in a power point.
